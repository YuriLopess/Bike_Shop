<h2>Description:</h2>

This project, developed for the Front-End I course at Fiap, simulates a bicycle store website with a minimalist and clean design. Currently, the website does not have a responsive layout, therefore, for a better experience, it is recommended to view it on screens with a resolution of approximately 1300px wide.

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>

* **HTML:** Base language for structuring the page content.
* **CSS:** Visual styling of the website, including layout, colors, typography, and other visual elements.
* **JavaScript:** Adding interactive features to the website, such as drop-down menus, animations, and form validation.
* **Font Awesome:** Library of icons and vector symbols that enrich the website's design.
